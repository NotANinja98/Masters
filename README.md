The Study Beyond the Standard Model of Vector-Like Quarks

We study vector quark production through Calchep and HEPMDB, programs which
simulate the more advanced physics occurring within high energy collisions. We have set
the collisions within an environment like one expected in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
where we study the interactions and decays of particles under these extreme conditions.
We then compare the results to those done at the Large Hadron Collider to identify the
benefits and failings of the programs.
